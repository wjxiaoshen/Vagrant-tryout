version of vagrant used: 1.8.5
version of virtualbox used : 5.1.2

I implement the Vagrantfile based on Vagrantfile-windows. 
  # The goal is to implement following
  # 1. Use provided Vagrantfile_windows file to construct a VirtualBox VM.
  # 2. Enable the VMs basic config, networking and file sharing
  # 3. Modify the Vagrantfile to install a web app of your choice(tried apache2 and nginx)
  # 4. Modify the Vagrantfile to configure the web app and OS.
  # 5. Create a script that queries checkip.dyndns.org, and appends the output to a file according to required format.
  # 6. Create a text document that explains how your script
 
 Usage:
 checkout my code
 "vagrant up"  will deploy the VM
 a VM will be deployed to VirtualBox with web-app installed
 an outputFormat.txt file will be generated as query output in format: <datetimestamp> | <script output>
 "vagrant ssh"  can get into the VM
 exit
 "vagrant destroy"  can destroy the VM.
